# Our Mission: Forge a New Path

- **From Legacy (OldCo)**: Manual, Proprietary, Slow
- **To Modern (NewCo)**: Cloud-Native, Open-Source, Agile
- **The Tools**: Python, Docker, K8s, GitHub, Jenkins...
- **The Challenge**: Overcoming skepticism, Proving the 'Why'

Note:
"We called ourselves 'NewCo' – because we weren't just building a new platform; we were forging a new way of working within Vodafone.
Our mission was ambitious: build a modern, cloud-native, open-source alternative to the 'OldCo' way. We embraced Python, Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub, Jenkins – tools and concepts that were completely new, even alien, to many around us. This newness naturally bred skepticism. 'Why change?' 'Why _this_ way?' 'Why can't we just use what we have?' These were questions many of us heard often, and our first task was often simply explaining the vision."

# The Team

- **Pathfinders**: Anshu, Tadas, Sascha, Irina, and others
- **Guardians**: Vitor, Ilona, Michael, Anoop, and their colleagues
- **Builders**: The team I was privileged to be a part of

Note:
- First, we had the **Pathfinders** – people like Anshu, Tadas, Sascha, Irina, and others – the architects, POs, Scrum Masters who charted the course, providing the technical and process direction. They held the map.
- Then, we had the **Guardians** – our champions, our advocates. Vitor, Ilona, Michael, Anoop, and their colleagues formed a vital protective layer. They faced the headwinds, engaged with stakeholders from Group and internally, secured budgets, and defended our approach. They were our essential firewall, allowing us the space and freedom to build.
- And finally, there were the **Builders** – the team I was privileged to be a part of initially. We were the ones sleeves-rolled-up, translating the vision into reality, coding, testing, deploying, and figuring things out together as we went."

# Our Culture: Learn, Show, Share

**The 3 Ds:**

- **Drawings**: Communicate complex ideas simply.
- **Documentation**: Everything in GitHub, Markdown, Mermaid.
- **Demonstrations**: Showcase progress, invite feedback.

Note:
"What truly defined NewCo, for me, was our culture. We were all learning! Remember, this was before the days you could just ask a Generative AI for the answer. We had to genuinely dig in, learn these new technologies, experiment, sometimes fail, and teach each other. We built the platform _and_ our skills simultaneously. We developed a rhythm:

- We used **Drawings** to communicate our vision and complex ideas simply.
- We **Documented** everything, primarily in GitHub using Markdown and Mermaid, making knowledge accessible.
- And we held numerous **Demonstrations**, within and outside the team, to showcase progress, invite feedback, and continuously improve.
  Crucially, we realized skepticism often stemmed from misunderstanding. So, we actively reached out. Our weekly brown bag sessions weren't just presentations; they were hands-on demos of Kubernetes, Docker, Python. They were our way of demystifying the 'new,' sharing our excitement, and turning curious colleagues, even skeptics, into allies. And it worked!"

# My Journey: Fueling the Start

- Building the initial platform.
- Getting NewCo operationalized.
- Moving to AI/ML topics.

Note:
"Personally, my NewCo journey had its own arc. I came in with some technical 'fuel,' which I poured into helping build our initial momentum. But eventually, I realised my tank for that specific part of the journey was running low; the knowledge I started with had been applied. We had built a working platform in production! The project's next phase rightfully shifted focus towards areas like Data Warehousing, away from the initial transformation build. It needed different expertise to keep accelerating. That realisation led me to step back and pivot towards AI/ML, reskilling myself and delivering projects in that space. But even from the sidelines, watching NewCo evolve into NextArt and achieve success filled me with immense pride."

# Our Legacy: More Than a Platform

- **Delivered**: A functional, modern, cloud-native platform.
- **Pioneered**: Open-source & new ways of working in Vodafone.
- **Cultivated**: Incredible talent and invaluable skills.
- **Proved**: Innovation thrives even against the odds.
- **Impact**: Changed perspectives and shaped the cloud journey.

Note:
"Did we tick every single box on the original, ambitious roadmap? Few truly disruptive projects ever do. But let's focus on what we _did_ achieve, because it's significant. We built a functional, modern, platform. We proved the value of open-source and cloud-native approaches within Vodafone. We fostered incredible talent and demonstrated a new, agile way of working. We changed perspectives. The NewCo project, later NextArt, may be ending, but its legacy lives on. It lives on in the skills we all gained, the relationships we built, the tangible impact on Vodafone's cloud journey, and the powerful proof that innovation _can_ thrive here, even against the odds."
